# cardiovascular-disease-prediction-using-quantum-machine-learning
This project aims to leverage Quantum Machine Learning (QML) techniques to predict cardiovascular diseases, this study seeks to demonstrate the potential of QML in healthcare analytics, particularly in diagnosing cardiovascular conditions. utilizing the advantages of quantum algorithms to enhance predictive performance.
Superposition: Qubits can exist in multiple states at once (both 0 and 1) due to superposition. This allows quantum computers to process a vast amount of possibilities simultaneously.
Entanglement: Qubits can become entangled, meaning the state of one qubit is dependent on the state of another, regardless of the distance between them. This property can be exploited to perform complex computations more efficiently.
